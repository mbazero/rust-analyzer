# Specification Quality Checklist: Move Item Refactoring

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… ALL CHECKS PASSED

**Clarification Resolved:**
- FR-005: User selected Option B (always use named file style). Updated to specify: "System MUST use named file style (e.g., `module_name.rs`) when creating new modules, consistent with modern Rust conventions (Rust 2018+)"

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- User stories are well-prioritized and independently testable (P1: sibling moves, P2: move+rename, P3: cross-boundary with auto-creation)
- Edge cases comprehensively identified (9 scenarios covered)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (6 measurable outcomes)
- All functional requirements are clear and testable (19 requirements defined)
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for module style, encoding, workspace structure, import style, and cancellation behavior
