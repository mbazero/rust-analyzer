# Tasks: Move Item Refactoring

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is infrastructure-level code requiring TDD approach per rust-analyzer constitution.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Implementation Guides**:
- üìö **[IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Detailed step-by-step guide with code examples for all 30 MVP tasks
- üöÄ **[QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)** - Get started in 30 minutes with skeleton and first test

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **rust-analyzer monorepo**: `crates/` at repository root
- Core logic: `crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/move_item.rs` (new file)
- Extensions: `crates/ide/src/rename.rs`, `crates/ide-db/src/rename.rs`
- Tests: Inline in `move_item.rs` using `expect-test`

- [X] T008 [P] Implement path parsing function to detect fully-qualified paths in crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/move_item.rs
- [X] T009 Implement path validation (syntax + semantics) in crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/move_item.rs

- [X] T011 [P] Create test helper functions for fixture-based testing in crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/move_item.rs
- [X] T012 Add regression marks using cov_mark in crates/ide-assists/src/handlers/move_item.rs

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Move Item to Sibling Module (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable moving items to sibling modules (same parent directory) with file creation and import updates

**Independent Test**: Create struct in one file, invoke rename with sibling module path, verify struct in new file with imports updated

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Edge Cases (Phase 6)**: Can run in parallel with user stories or after
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 infrastructure but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 + US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (TDD) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Implementation tasks are mostly sequential within a story
- Tests can be written in parallel (marked with [P])
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup tasks (Phase 1)**: All marked [P] can run in parallel (T002-T005)
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T007-T008, T010-T012 can run in parallel
- **User Story Tests**: All tests within a story marked [P] can be written in parallel
- **Edge Case Tests**: All marked [P] can run in parallel (T059-T065)
- **Polish**: Tasks T071-T077 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Write all US1 tests in parallel (before implementation):
Task: "Test: Move struct to new sibling file" (T013)
Task: "Test: Move struct to existing sibling file" (T014)
Task: "Test: Move function to sibling module" (T015)
Task: "Test: Move enum with variants" (T016)
Task: "Test: Update imports after move" (T017)
Task: "Test: Update all references" (T018)

# Then implement sequentially:
Task: "Implement is_sibling_move()" (T019)
Task: "Implement target file path computation" (T020)
# ... and so on
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (write tests ‚Üí verify fail ‚Üí implement ‚Üí verify pass)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with quickstart.md scenarios
5. **MVP COMPLETE**: Can ship sibling module moves

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Ship MVP** (sibling moves)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Ship (move + rename)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Ship (full hierarchy creation)
5. Add Edge Cases + Polish ‚Üí Ship (production-ready)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (tests + implementation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (tests + implementation)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (tests + implementation)
   - Developer D: Edge cases (T059-T070)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team collaborates on Polish phase

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files/aspects, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD is mandatory** per rust-analyzer constitution: Write tests ‚Üí Verify fail ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Verify pass
- Use `expect-test` for snapshot testing (update with `env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo qt`)
- Use `cov_mark` for regression tracking
- Commit after each major milestone (phase completion, story completion)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All tests must pass before moving to next phase: `cargo test && cargo test -p xtask`
- Performance target: < 10 seconds per move operation
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts (minimize), cross-story dependencies that break independence
