# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends rust-analyzer's existing rename functionality to support moving items between modules using fully-qualified paths. When a user provides a fully-qualified path that differs from the item's current location, the system will move the item to the target module, create necessary module structure, and update all references.

## Glossary

- **Rename_System**: The rust-analyzer rename functionality being extended
- **Item**: A Rust language construct that can be renamed (struct, enum, function, etc.)
- **Fully_Qualified_Path**: A complete path specification starting with `crate::` or module path
- **Target_Module**: The destination module specified in the fully-qualified path
- **Source_Module**: The current module containing the item to be moved
- **Module_Structure**: The file and directory organization representing Rust modules

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want to move and rename items using fully-qualified paths, so that I can reorganize my code structure efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user invokes rename on an item and provides a fully-qualified path, THE Rename_System SHALL parse the path to determine target location and new name
2. IF the target path differs from the current item location, THEN THE Rename_System SHALL initiate a move operation
3. THE Rename_System SHALL validate that the provided path is syntactically correct for Rust
4. THE Rename_System SHALL extract the new item name from the final segment of the path
5. THE Rename_System SHALL identify the target module from all path segments except the final one

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want the system to create missing module structure automatically, so that I don't have to manually create directories and files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the target module does not exist, THE Rename_System SHALL create the necessary directory structure
2. THE Rename_System SHALL create module files following Rust conventions (mod.rs or module_name.rs)
3. WHERE user preferences specify module file organization, THE Rename_System SHALL respect those preferences
4. THE Rename_System SHALL add appropriate module declarations to parent modules
5. THE Rename_System SHALL ensure created modules are properly integrated into the module tree

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want all imports and references to be updated automatically, so that my code remains compilable after the move.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Rename_System SHALL identify all references to the moved item across the codebase
2. THE Rename_System SHALL update import statements to reflect the new item location
3. THE Rename_System SHALL update fully-qualified references to use the new path
4. THE Rename_System SHALL handle both direct references and re-exports
5. THE Rename_System SHALL preserve existing import aliases where applicable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want references within the moved item to be updated for the new module context, so that the moved code continues to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Rename_System SHALL analyze imports and references within the moved item's code
2. THE Rename_System SHALL update relative module references that become invalid in the new location
3. THE Rename_System SHALL adjust `super::` and `crate::` references as needed for the new module hierarchy
4. THE Rename_System SHALL update any self-referential paths within the moved item
5. THE Rename_System SHALL ensure that sibling module references are updated when the item moves to a different module level

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want the move operation to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I can trust the refactoring won't break my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the target location already contains an item with the same name, THEN THE Rename_System SHALL report a conflict error
2. IF the item has dependencies that cannot be moved, THEN THE Rename_System SHALL report dependency errors
3. THE Rename_System SHALL validate that the move operation will not create circular dependencies
4. THE Rename_System SHALL ensure moved items maintain their visibility constraints
5. WHERE the move would violate Rust's module privacy rules, THE Rename_System SHALL report visibility errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want to move items within the same module using the same interface, so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the target path specifies the same module as the current location, THE Rename_System SHALL perform only a rename operation
2. THE Rename_System SHALL support relative path specifications within the current module
3. THE Rename_System SHALL handle both simple renames and same-module moves uniformly
4. THE Rename_System SHALL preserve the existing behavior for simple identifier renames
5. THE Rename_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing rename functionality
